victories:
  - Parallax layers that can easily be tweaked
  - Organizing the environment and palette in a way that makes tinkering and balancing easy
  - Birds are smoothly animated and sound like bit birds
  - Smooth camera that has some intelligent design to it
todos:
  - Add a worm protagonist
  - I had an idea for a chief bird who lurks about and delivers the end
  - A burnout effect could be fun, for players who smash too hard on the thrust
  - Some weather effects for higher levels

This was my first complete pico-8 game, a sort of vertical infinite runner.

I've always loved parallax and thought it was a perfect way to elevate an otherwise simplistic set of sprites. The combination of lofi with smooth and reactive animation can be surprisingly satisfying.

Try to fly as high as you can while dodging the ravens. Can you get high enough to see the colors change?

[PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php "PICO-8 Fantasy Console") is a virtual console.
