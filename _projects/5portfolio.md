victories:
  - Staying as DRY as I can while still supporting the diversity of work I have done
  - Used a custom project collection so I'm not shoehorning my thoughts into the default post structure
  - Avoided themes to keep myself honest about my current abilities
todos:
  - Make more projects, especially in JavaScript
  - Make the site faster for those on slow connections
  - Use Javascript to make things a bit more dynamic

The site you are viewing now.

I wanted to build a simple, static site to display my projects so far.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) kept me in the Ruby mindset and was quick to get working, thanks to GitHub Pages.
