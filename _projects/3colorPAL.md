I want to deepen my JavaScript and React knowledge, so this is a starter project.

So far it is a very basic component structure, but uses the modern hook + functional component patterns.

I originally thought of this because I often find myself trying to figure out color palettes for knitting projects in a photo editor, which can be quite tedious. I'd love for this to use the Ravelry API to pull in actual yarn color images, but wanted to start with the basic functionality first.

I'd also like to spend some time making it mobile friendly, and more fun to use (some animation).

Stretch goals would include allowing a photo upload that we could extract a palette from.
