This is a [lumines](https://luminesremastered.com) demake on the cozy PICO-8 console.

Form 2x2 squares to score points.
You can build combos while a square fades, for extra points.
Let the sound guide you, pacing is more effective than pure speed.

[PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php "PICO-8 Fantasy Console") is a lovely way to learn game development, as the constraints guide the design decisions.

I had some ideas for a versus version of this game, like puzzle fighter, but wanted to start out with a simple single player prototype to test the feel and rules.
