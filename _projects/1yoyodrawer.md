The goal for this project was to take an idea from concept to reality, completely on my own.

Before this, I had only done rails in the safety of a tutorial. I learn through doing, so this type of project took my relationship with rails to a new depth.

The yoyo drawer allows me to upload yoyos and displays them as a collection, with a bit of data about each.

I've been asked many times how many yoyos I own, and if I continue to catalog mine here, one day I might know the answer.
