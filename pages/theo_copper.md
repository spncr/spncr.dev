# Copper Theodore
*Updated: September 2021*

A copper yoyo isn't very practical. It smells and it is sensitive and it is constantly in a state of flux.

If you play with it constantly, your touch will buff the surface, leaving shiny rose traces of your affection.
If left alone, it will darken.
Moisture, acid, and fingers may leave marks.
Polish it for a special occasion, but the history will remain, a veil beyond the shine.

I had this batch blasted, then plated in copper. This is meant to be utilitarian or an underplate, not cosmetic. The process left some permanent splatter marks on every yoyo.

I hesitated to release these at all. They are not perfect. They are not competition grade spin machines. They will not outperform in any way.

They might get better with age, if you enjoy an ephemeral patina. They will become more predictable with practice, but they will not outperform.

These patina in layers, to reflect the life it has had. The shoddy plating job is only their birth story, what happens next?

I decided to release the Copper Theodore because I love them and I want to share, if you are up for the challenge.

They're grumpy, heavy, open to the challenge of you.

1. A fresh Copper Theodore next to my aggressively loved Theodore
2. Copper Theodore, ready to sell
3. Loved, Raw, and Ready: the plating job is imperfect
4. Angled to show the remaining splatter marks
5. Nine splatter examples, highly inconsistent

## Disclaimers

**Every single yoyo has some form of splatter marks** from the copper plating process. This plating is considered "non-cosmetic".

The blasted texture is easily marred by fingerprints or moisture. Any marks made early in the life of the yoyo tend to show up indefinitely and become part of the patina. An exaggerated, imperfect aging process is expected.

We manually finished each yoyo with steel wool, to reduce the splattering and to make the surface more touchable. We did our best to not leave any new marks or finger prints. Some yoyos do have marks, either from the plating process or the steel wool scrub or a bad job.

The machine lines are also visible, even through blasting and steel wooling.

Copper smells. Your hands will smell and your string will get dirty when you play with this yoyo.

## Specs
* Machined by Alvin Rollins of Foxland Precision in 2017, before the shop was shut down. That was in Tennesse, in the States.
* 6063 Aluminum. Copper plated with a non-cosmetic process that patinas aggressively, even from the air.
* 70g+ assembled. A naked half is ~33g.
* 38mm wide, 54.5mm diameter
* Nasty rubber shield C bearing, recessed to 3.6mm gap
* **Tug responsive, short spin**
* Snow tires, a custom kitty fat string

## Price
$160 USD, shipped, wherever you are

## Terms
I'm just one person slowly making yoyos and charging for the trouble. There won't be any more batches.

1. Read and accept the [disclaimers above](#disclaimers)
2. The plating is not meant to be cosmetic, which is part of why the process looks shit.
3. They might cut strings. If they do, you can sand the corner where the wall begins, something like 600 grit usually is enough. All of my yoyos have cut strings, including Walter. Play carefully the first few strings!
5. They are overpriced. There is nothing special about these to warrant the price.
6. You won't hurt my feelings if you don't buy one, but you might hurt my feelings if you do buy one and hate it.
7. I buy **really** shitty bearings, they have rubber shields and they're greasy and they take for damn ever to wear in and because of the plating they're actually pretty hard to remove the first time.

## Dirty Editions
I took a few Copper Theodores and bathed them in my garage, which damages them but in a kinda pretty way.

They come out rough and vibey and cutting strings. I work them again with steel wool, trying to keep as much of the colorful patina as I can, but running my (gloved) finger around the string zone to make sure it is smooth. Then I do a light brush in the cups to break off any leftover salt or crust. Then I add the bearing and spin test them.

They play much worse than the clean ones, but they also take a lot more work, so I am still charging more.

They're one of a kind, what you see if what you get.

Breaking these in is extra tough, they're literally crusty and need some hard work.
