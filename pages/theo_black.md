### Buy a Theodore

By purchasing, you acknowledge:

1. Â You will receive a working Theodore with a greasy bearing. I tested it, it works.
2. Â I am not a company, you aren't getting a return policy or a customer service department, just me and my preference for gunked up yoyos that can take a beating.
3. I thought these would require sanding, but they didn't cut strings at all in my testing. They still is a chance you'll cut a string or two! Be careful in the first few days.
4. The engraver did an okay job - you can read the numbers - but they aren't ðŸŒŸðŸ’¯ðŸ”¥. If you are going to be bothered by a less than perfect engraving, please refrain from purchase.
5. These are shipping unassembled, wrapped in paper, bearing seated, axle separate but ready. Nothing nice about the box. I want these to be used and the collectors box on Walter seemed to dissuade that.
6. The price reflects my time and the demand. This yoyo is no better than any other aluminum on the market, and is purposefully priced.
7. Sorry I'ma grouch. Long road.
8. Make sure your shipping address is proper on checkout! No rush here, you have a reservation.

### Don't Pay Here

They're sold out!

## Theodore Information

Theodore is another retro-modern throw following in Walter's footsteps.

### The Concept

The same ideas pervade the concept: responsive, soft in the hand, durable, hardcoat, built for play.

TheodoreÂ is wider than Walter. Â That is the main difference.

Theodore ships with a terrible, gunked-up, rubber shield bearing. This keeps it responsive. It tends to get worse before it gets better, so patience required to really find the sweet spot.

### Prototypes

I worked with two different shops and did three completely different prototypes to arrive at the final design. I am happy with it.

### Specs

38mm wide 54.5mm diameter C bearing, recessed to 3.6mm gap nasty rubber shield bearing snow tires kitty fat

### Editions

#### The Player's Edition

The made to play edition in a smooth black hardcoat, serial'd just like Walter.

These ship without packaging, tested but unassembled.

**Shipping now, launched May 5th, 2018.**

**Price**: $150 shipped in the US or in person, $160 shipped outside the US.

#### The Metal Edition

This will come much later, as they're a dream project that will take a while to get together. I'm thinking 2020, but my deadlines never stick.

They will be metal plated Theodores (probably ~40)Â with some (hopefully) special packaging. Â The pricing and realityÂ of this 2nd run is still up in the air, so don't hold me to any specific details. Â IÂ only mention it here so that folks don't get upset they bought a player's edition if they wanted a metal plated version. Or visa versa.

**Release date:** 2020

**Price**:Â Expensive. Probably $200+ but won't know for sure until much later.

### Player's Edition Theodore is sold out - Copper Edition is mostly ready.
